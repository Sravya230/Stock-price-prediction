Stock-Price-Prediction
The Stock Price Analyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to predict future stock prices using the SVR (Support Vector Regression) algorithm. It uses the Finance Modelling Prep (FMP) API to retrieve real-time stock data and allows users to download stock data, visualize the 52-week high, plot predicted prices, and compare stock performance between two companies.


Technologies Used: 

Python: Main programming language for building the application.
SVR (Support Vector Regression): For predicting future stock prices based on historical data.
Streamlit: For deploying the web-based interactive application.
Finance Modelling Prep (FMP) API: For fetching real-time and historical stock data.
Matplotlib/Plotly: For visualizing the stock data, including plotting graphs for 52-week high and predicted stock prices.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Features:

Stock Data Fetching: Uses the FMP API to retrieve historical and real-time stock data for analysis.
Download Stock Data: Allows users to download stock data in CSV format for offline analysis.
52-Week High Visualization: Plots the 52-week high for the selected stock to visualize trends.
Stock Price Prediction: Uses the SVR algorithm to predict future stock prices based on historical data and plots them for comparison.
Comparison Between Stocks: Allows users to compare the stock performance of two different companies side by side.
Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit to provide an interactive and easy-to-use interface for stock analysis and prediction.
